Composer App

            {`Hi, I'm David Pocknee and this is an app I created in 2018 to help me finish composing my
          guitar piece`}
            <i>Every</i>
, which I started in 2013.
            <i>Every</i>
            {`
is around 10 minutes in
          length and is "a compendium of almost every playable guitar chord of 1-6 notes solely
          containing the note E and consisting only of fingered pitches or natural harmonics (up to
          the 5th partial)".`}
          </p>
          <p>
            This app was built with ReactJS and the webaudio API, and allows the user to drag and
            drop all 319 chords in the piece into an order of their choice. A sythesized version of
            the re-ordered piece (algorithmically spliced together from samples) can then be played
            back by clicking the play and stop buttons in the bottom right of the window.
            <br />
            The slider in the bottom left of the window can be used to choose the chord from which
            this playback starts.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you have decided upon an order of chords that you like, it can be converted into
            musical notation in the liypond format by using the controls at the bottom of the
            window.
          </p>
          <p>Each chord is represented by a set of statistics to help aid its ordering: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A chord reference number (e.g. chord_123). This is color-coded according to the
              duration before the next chord. long=green, short=red.
            </li>
            <li>
              A color-coded rating of how difficult the chord is to play (1=easy/green, 9=very
              difficult/red). By matching the colors of the chord number and the difficulty, you can
              ensure that the most difficult chords only occur in parts of the piece where there is
              a large amount of time for their preparation and execution.
            </li>
            <li>
              The number of notes in the chord (also color-coded - the more notes the darker the
              color).
            </li>
            <li>The percentage of notes in the chord that are harmonics.</li>
            <li>
              A histogram showing how the sounding pitches in each chord are distributed over the
              five possible octaves.
            </li>
            <li>The chord represented in tablature and standard guitar notation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can see which statistic you are looking at by hovering your mouse over it.</p>
          <p>
            As well as being a tool for me, the composer, I also thought that it could be used by
            performers of the work to make fine-tuning adjustments to the order of chords in the
            piece in order to aid playability, and personalize and shape the work according to the
            idiosyncracies of their playing and instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, by making this code available online, I hope that it might be useful in
            helping other composers and performers to build similar interfaces for their musical
            projects. All of the code can be found at

            free to take a look and adapt as necessary. I learned alot about ReactJS and building
            drag-and-drop interfaces via this tutorial for the ReactJS DnD library
