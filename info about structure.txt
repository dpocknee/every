DIAGRAM OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS (I haven't bothered including layout components

			index.html (main page)
			+ timing.js (JSON formatted list of all timings of chords - loaded into window.timing variable)
			+ chords.js (JSON formatted list of all chords with notation and all stats - loaded into window.chords variable)
			+ a window.mainArray variable which contains the current order of chords
				and can be read and written to by both React and webaudio

into each GridSquare)


Block.js (The block that can be moved around)

------------------------------------
NOTE: In order to have React and webaudio work together without using some type of intermediary state management framework, 
they are kept completely separate and have no idea what each other is doing.  The only variables they both have access to are:
window.mainArray
window.timing
window.chords 
and
webaudio.js is able to get the value of the playback slider to know where to start
using a document.getElementById('playback').value command
